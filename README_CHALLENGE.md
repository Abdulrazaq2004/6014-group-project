Cyber6014 Game – Challenge & Project Route README
1. Project Challenge

The main challenge addressed by the Cyber6014 Game is the lack of cybersecurity awareness among technology students and adult internet users.
While cybersecurity threats such as phishing, Social media privacy, and weak password practices are increasingly common, many users still lack practical knowledge on how these attacks work and how to avoid them.

Traditional learning methods, such as long documents, presentations, or text-heavy websites, are often boring and discouraging. As a result, users may lose interest quickly and fail to retain important cybersecurity concepts.
The key challenge, therefore, was to design a solution that educates users about cybersecurity risks in a way that is engaging, interactive, and easy to understand.

2. Why This Project Was Chosen

This project was chosen to address the challenge by combining education and engagement through gamification.

Instead of relying on static learning materials, Cyber6014 was designed as a web-based game that allows users to:

Learn through interaction rather than reading

Test their knowledge in a competitive environment

Stay motivated through points, levels, and progression

A web-based platform was selected to ensure easy access without requiring installation, making the system available to a wider audience across different devices and operating systems.

3. Chosen Project Route

To solve the identified challenge, the team followed a clear route in terms of technical decisions, design approach, and learning structure.

3.1 Technical Route

The project was developed as a lightweight web application using:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for accessibility and simplicity

Firebase for authentication and data storage

Firebase was chosen to handle user accounts, credentials, and progress securely without the complexity of building a custom backend. This decision allowed the team to focus more on user experience and learning outcomes rather than server management.

3.2 Design Route

The design route focused on creating a cyber-themed but friendly interface:

Dark backgrounds with soft neon effects to reflect a cybersecurity theme

Eye-comfortable colors to reduce visual fatigue

Simple layouts with clear navigation

Unlike many cybersecurity platforms that use intimidating “hacker-style” visuals, Cyber6014 aims to feel approachable and suitable for learning rather than fear-based messaging.

3.3 Learning & Gameplay Route

The learning route was designed around progressive learning:

Users select a category (e.g., phishing, BAC)

Users choose a difficulty level

Each level requires answering three questions correctly

Users must complete a level to unlock the next difficulty

If a user fails to complete a level, the system provides educational hints or explanations before allowing another attempt. This ensures that learning happens even when the user makes mistakes.

4. How the Project Meets the Challenge

Cyber6014 directly addresses the original challenge through the following approaches:

Identified Problem	Cyber6014 Solution
Low user engagement	Interactive quiz-based gameplay
Difficulty understanding real threats	Real-world cybersecurity examples
Lack of motivation	Points, levels, and leaderboard
One-size-fits-all learning	Categories and difficulty levels
Fear-based cybersecurity messaging	Friendly and educational tone

By combining these elements, the platform encourages users to learn cybersecurity concepts in a practical and enjoyable way.

5. Future Direction

If the project were extended, planned future enhancements include:

Private rooms for teachers or administrators

Small competitive tournaments with private leaderboards

Expanded question banks across more cybersecurity topics

Hint system that help the users tackle challenges

These future features would further strengthen the educational and competitive value of the platform.

6. Conclusion

Cyber6014 Game was designed to solve the problem of low cybersecurity awareness by offering a gamified, accessible, and engaging learning experience.
Through careful technical, design, and learning decisions, the project provides a clear and justified route from the original challenge to a practical solution that supports both education and user engagement.
